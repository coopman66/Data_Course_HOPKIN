# Data_Course_HOPKIN
This README file contains information about my uploaded assignments. This is the github repo for my BIOL 3100 class.
Each R project and script I write for this class will go in this repository. This course will involve data analysis
techniques for biologists. This is a class to learn R. R seems to be similar to python. I can't think of another 
edit to make, so the next one will be the final edit (to what it's going to look like for the rest of the class.
