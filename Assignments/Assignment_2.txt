## Shell practice tasks:

1. For each of the filenames that begin with "M" in the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data/pdb" list the number of lines in each file.

2. Redirect the output from the previous task to a new file named "m_lines.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/"

3. For the file "animals.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data/" get an alphabetical list of the unique animal types that were observed and redirect this list to "unique_animals.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/"

4. In the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/" there is a file named "BioLog_Plate_Data.csv"
Write a command that gives a list of the unique carbon substrates the biolog plate measured, and which saves this list as "unique_C-substrates.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/" 

5. In the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data/" write a command that finds the longest .txt file (by number of lines)
	Hint: wc, sort, tail, head

6. In the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/many_files/" there are a large number of subdirectories. Buried inside these subdirectories are some .txt files that all contain a list of numbers (one interger per line). 
There is a shell script in the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/scripts" called "sum_lines.sh"

Your task is to run this script on ALL the .txt files buried within the "many_files/" directory to output the sums of all the lines in each file. This output (on all those files) should be saved in a single file named "file_sums.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/"
	This is a tough one. Remember that to run a shell script you need to type "bash PATH_TO_SCRIPT"
	Hint: find -exec, for loop

for loop reminder:

# this will cycle through the values 1 through 10
# with each new value, it will pause for 1 second, and then echo the current value to the screen

for i in {1..10}
 do
 sleep 1
 echo $i
 done

On one line, it would look like this:
for i in {1..10};do sleep 1;echo $i;done
