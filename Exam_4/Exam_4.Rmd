# This is Exam 4
## You can do this on your own time, at home, if you prefer.

## The instructions are simple:
+ Pick an exam to re-do
+ Re-do that exam
+ Push that exam to GitHub under the *Exam_4* directory (i.e., don't overwrite the exam you are re-doing)
+ That is all

**Note: The grade you earn on your re-do will also be earned for Exam 4.**

**So, if you bring your Exam 1 score up to 100, you will also get 100 on Exam 4**
