The data set we will use is called /data/mushroom_growth.csv


This was a fully-factorial experiment designed to find optimal temperatures for growing two 
species of mushrooms. I varied the levels of nitrogen (mg/g soil), light (hours per day),
humidity (ambient vs high), and temperature (deg C).

The response variable was growth rate (g/day).

Submit an R script that imports and analyzes this data, 
include code for a predictive model and meaningful plots.

Look for what factors best predict high mushroom growth rates and back up your figures with
statistical signifigance tests.

Upload your .R script to canvas.
