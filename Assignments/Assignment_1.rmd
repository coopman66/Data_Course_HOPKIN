## Assignment 1

________________
#### First, read the following document. It will set the stage for version control and why we will be using it.

1.  If you do not have R installed on your computer, install it. Google "how to install R" for instructions.
2.  Install RStudio on your computer. [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download]
3.  Download and install git and create an account on github.com. Choose a professional-sounding username!
4.  Create a new repository on your GitHub page called "Data_Course_YOUR-LAST-NAME"
  + Look for the "+" in the top menu
  + Enter the name "Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME" where prompted
  + Leave the "Public" option checked
  + Be sure to check the box "Initialize this repository with a README"

5.  Back in your terminal, navigate to your Desktop

6.  Clone the course materials onto your desktop by typing: git clone "https://github.com/gzahn/Data_Course"
	This will directly create a new folder on your desktop called "Data_Course"
	This directory will contain everything that I have uploaded onto the course github repository

7.  Make sure you're still in your Desktop directory and now clone the github page you created (The one called Data_Course_YOUR-LAST-NAME)
  + Hint: use the same git clone command as above, but modify the web address to your new GitHub repository (Copy and paste from the web browser)
	This will import the website repository onto your personal computer (as a git repository)

8.  Navigate into this new repository (The one called Data_Course_YOUR-LAST-NAME) and type the following commands:
  + echo "This README file contains information about my uploaded assignments" >> README.md
  + git add README.md
  + git commit -m "1st commit"
  + git push
	(Here it will ask for your GitHub userID and password....enter those when asked)
	This series of commands commits your changes (Adding that text to the README.md file) and pushes the changes back onto the website version

9. Check back on your GitHub page online...if you see that new text ("This README file contains information about my uploaded assignments") then you are finished!

10. To get credit, upload a link to your GitHub repository to "Assignment 1" in Canvas. I'll click on that and see whether your README.md file is correct.

#### We will discuss what is actually going on with all of this in class, but this is to test whether you can follow precise instructions and troubleshoot.

#### **Don't be afraid to ask others/instructor/Google for help with this!**
